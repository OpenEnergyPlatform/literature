  abstract  = {Heterogeneous data, different definitions and incompatible models are a huge problem in many domains, with no exception for the field of energy systems analysis. Hence, it is hard to re-use results, compare model results or couple models at all. Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we present the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) developed for the domain of energy systems analysis. Using the OEO provides several benefits for the community. First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform (OEP). Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable, re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the OEO are demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and interface homogenisation. We also describe how the ontology can be used for linked open data (LOD).}

  abstract = {The Open Energy Ontology (OEO) is a BFO-based ontology for the domain of energy system analysis. Core of this domain is the concept of energy. Since the concept of energy is ambiguous and has not (yet) been introduced into BFO, we describe why the OEO classifies energy as a quality. We present how energy is differentiated from energy carriers, fuels and other related concepts. The process of energy conversion makes it possible to depict many different types of its generation and usage. Further, we describe the concept of origin of matter and energy. In this article, we define the core concepts of the OEO according to the BFO. We thus demonstrate how the OEO enables the consistent use of core concepts throughout the energy system analysis domain.}

  abstract = {The field of energy systems research is highly interdisciplinary and handles large amounts of complex data. This complexity calls for specific data management methods. Formal structures like ontologies are increasingly being used to organize information of this field. However, such methods have to be balanced against application development needs. Thus, it is important to be able to evaluate the usefulness of an ontology. This paper is about translating example research questions into queries. These queries can be used to evaluate the completeness of an ontology. They are an instance of what in ontology development are called competency questions. We focus on their use in test first infrastructures. The output of this study is a collection of nine such queries with a detailed explanation of how they were designed. These results are intended to offer an energy systems researcher strategies to organize their demands in regards knowledge graph design. This may help them perform better data management decisions, which have implications on understandability and performance. We emphasize that knowledge organization in such an interdisciplinary field requires splitting up the effort into smaller research units that can later be unified in a larger knowledge graph.}
